  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I have been teaching eighth grade English at Trinity Middle School in Washington, PA since 2005. Growing up, my father always enjoyed learning about new technologies, and we always had the newest gadgets. In fact, we were one of the first homes I knew of to own a personal computer. Because of this, I was able to experiment with the computer as a young teenager, and I enjoyed playing games and exploring the early internet. Of course, fighting with my siblings for a turn on our first Nintendo system was another formative technological experience for me.</p>

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>Code is all around us. After completing the data visualization activity, I learned that I struggle with collecting data throughout a long period of time. One of the biggest issues for me in engaging in this activity involved the sheer amount of technology I interact with on a daily basis. If I were to record every instance of interaction with technology, I would be recording all day and get nothing done. Therefore, I do not feel that my data visualization is very accurate. I tried to focus most on my technology use at school. I definitely don't think my records are detailed enough. However, I did notice that the two days with the fewest interactions with technology at work were our kickball and roller skating days, which makes sense because I was engaged in monitoring students and active participation. I was also surprised by my screen time throughout the week. I never usually check this data, and it made me want to put my phone down more and engage in the world around me. Finally, I think having students keep a "technology journal" to track technology use over a day or week could be a valuable activity in class and tie in to both CS and ELA skill sets.</p>

<!--In this section, we'll move from talking about us to how code and digital technology has affected the ELA classroom-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology in the ELA classroom</h2>
    <p>Technology has changed significantly since I began teaching in 2005. In those early days of teaching, we had one projector in the building, which we could sign out to project onto the whiteboard. Our computers were desktop models, and students did not have cell phones. I spent quite a bit of time at the copy machine, which I was adept at fixing.  
    
    <p></p>Though technology use did increase throughout the years, the Covid-19 pandemic created an immediate shift in the ways in which students and teachers used technology. Students in my district were each provided with a Chromebook, and our lessons were presented through Google Classroom and Canvas. In order to successfully teach virtually, I had to return to the basic goals of the curriculum and think about the new ways in which students could meet those goals through a different medium. For example, how could we use technology to conduct an asynchronous class discussion of a novel's theme in place of a Socratic seminar? 
    
    <p>It is important to think about the ways in which CT and code are impacting both the present and the future. Students are often more comfortable with these ideas and skills than educators, which sometimes puts us at a disadvantage when trying to embrace this new path and skill set. It is also important to consider issues of equity and accessibility as they relate to classroom technology and real-world experiences.   </p>

<!--Let's think a little about what we have learned and how we can apply this knowledge and skills moving forward.-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Moving forward with ELA literacies, computational thinking, and social justice</h2>
    <p>Throughout this professional development, I have learned several valuable skills and strategies that will help me to engage and equip students in my classroom with lifelong skills. For example, I could definitely adapt some of the activities we completed, like the "Jabberwocky" visualization exercise, the haiku exercise, and the movie plot generator, for my own classroom. I now feel much more confident and comfortable using the computational thinking terminology and determining the difference between pattern recognition, algorithms, data, decomposition, and abstractions. Moving forward, I would like to learn more specific activities and lesson plans that can help students to recognize the applicability of these skills to "real life" situations in the future. </p>
